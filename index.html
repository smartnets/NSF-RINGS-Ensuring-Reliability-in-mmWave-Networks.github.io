<h3>Synopsis
</h3>
<p>
This project aims at developing a framework that enables the characterization of fundamental resilience-capacity trade-offs over multi-hop mmWave networks, by leveraging novel opportunities such as beam scheduling, novel coding techniques as well as learning-based methods. Developing fundamental resilience-capacity performance trade-offs for mmWave networks, and offering guidelines on how to achieve these at scale with low-complexity techniques, are not well explored areas; this project aims to address this gap. This project brings together tools from several disciplines; in particular, we combine tools from information and coding theory, machine learning, algorithms, and networking to address the proposal goals.

</p>
<h3>Goals
</h3>
<p>
Overall, the major goals in this project can be summarized as follows:

</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Design mechanisms that suitably distribute the traffic across multiple paths in the mmWave network, with the two-fold objective of ensuring resilience against link blockages and/or node failures and achieve high end-to-end packet rate delivery.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Create (proactive) resilient information coding schemes that exhibit a graceful degradation in performance despite (a priori unknown) link blockages and node failures.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Develop low-complexity communication and scheduling mechanisms with high-degrees of resiliency at-scale that can be deployed over dense multi-hop mmWave networks where network resources might need to be shared to accommodate several users.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Develop intelligent mechanisms for multi-hop mmWave networks that leverage feedback to rapidly identify link blockages and node failures, and gracefully adapt to these.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Design decentralized backpressure algorithms that adapt to network failures.
</p>
</li>
<li>
    <p>Leverage Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques to autonomously adapt to failures.
    </p>
</li>
<li>
    <p>Analytically compare the proactive and reactive strategies across a range of performance metrics. Develop hybrid strategies that combine the two approaches, and provide network synthesis guidelines.
    </p>
</li>
<li>
    <p>Develop a proof-of-concept and demonstrate the performance of proactive, reactive and hybrid approaches of the previous tasks by means of testbed experimentation.
    </p>
</li>
<li>
    <p>Evaluate the performance of our mechanisms over more complex networks and traffic configurations than those that we will experimentally deploy.
    </p>
</li>
</ul>
